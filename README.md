# Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Yvettetuyambaze/User-auth.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd User-auth

Install dependencies for the backend:
cd backend
npm install

Install dependencies for the frontend:
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory.
Specify the following variables:
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

Create a .env file in the frontend directory.
Specify the following variable:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000



# Start the backend server:
cd ../backend
npm start

# Start the frontend development server:
cd ../frontend
npm start


# Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
On the signup page, fill in the required details (username, email, password) and click the signup button.
After successful signup, you will be redirected to the signin page.
Enter your credentials (username/email and password) and click the signin button.
If the authentication is successful, you will be redirected to the dashboard page or shown a welcome message.

# Technologies Used

Backend:

ExpressJS: Web application framework for Node.js
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For session management and authentication
bcrypt: For password hashing


Frontend:

ReactJS: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React Router: For client-side routing
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API

# API Endpoints

POST /api/signup: Create a new user account
POST /api/signin: Authenticate user credentials and generate a JWT token

# Security Measures

Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing in the database.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): JWT tokens are used for session management and authentication. The token is sent to the client upon successful authentication and is required for accessing protected routes.
Input Validation: Both frontend and backend implement input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

# Testing

Unit tests are implemented for critical components of the application.
To run the tests, use the following command:
cd backend
npm test

# Challenges and Constraints
During the development of this user authentication service, several challenges and constraints were encountered:

1. Email Verification: Implementing the email verification functionality posed a challenge. Although the frontend component for email verification was successfully developed, there were difficulties in sending verification emails to the user's email address from the backend. This issue needs to be investigated and resolved to ensure a complete and functional email verification process.

2. Google Authentication: While the frontend component for Google authentication was implemented, the backend integration remained incomplete. Integrating Google's OAuth mechanism and securely handling user authentication through Google requires further development and testing to ensure a seamless and secure 3. authentication process.
3. Time Constraints: There were limitations in terms of the features and enhancements that could be implemented. Prioritizing the core functionality and ensuring a stable and secure authentication system within the given timeframe was a significant challenge.

# Future Enhancements
To further improve and expand the functionality of the user authentication service, the following enhancements can be considered:

1. Complete Email Verification Backend: Finish the development of the backend component for email verification. Investigate and resolve the issues related to sending verification emails to users' email addresses. Ensure that the email verification process is fully functional and reliable.
2. Google Authentication Backend: Complete the backend integration for Google authentication. Implement the necessary endpoints and logic to securely handle user authentication through Google's OAuth mechanism. Thoroughly test the integration to ensure a smooth and secure authentication process.
Facebook Authentication: Extend the authentication service to include Facebook as an additional OAuth provider. Develop both the frontend and backend components to support Facebook authentication, allowing users to sign up and sign in using their Facebook accounts.
3. User Interface Enhancement: Enhance the user interface and user experience of the application. Gather user feedback and identify areas for improvement in terms of usability, visual design, and overall user satisfaction. Implement necessary changes and refinements to create a more intuitive and engaging user interface.

# Additional Features: 
Implement additional features to enhance the functionality and security of the authentication service. Some potential features include:

1. Password Reset: Allow users to reset their passwords securely through email verification.
2. User Profile Management: Enable users to manage their profile information, such as updating their username, email, or profile picture.
3. Two-Factor Authentication: Implement two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
4. Account Deletion: Provide users with the ability to delete their accounts and associated data.
